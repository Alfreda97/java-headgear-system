# Java Headgear Management System

This project is a Java application that models different types of headgear using object-oriented principles such as inheritance and polymorphism. The system allows calculations to be performed across different headgear types through a shared abstraction.

The project was designed and implemented independently as part of university coursework.

## Features
- Abstract base class for headgear
- Multiple concrete headgear implementations
- Polymorphic behaviour across headgear types
- Central calculator class for processing headgear data

## Technologies
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What I Learned
- Designing class hierarchies
- Using inheritance and polymorphism effectively
- Separating responsibilities across classes
- Writing clean, maintainable Java code
